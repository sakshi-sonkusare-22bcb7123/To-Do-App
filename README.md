# 😎 Java Swing To-Do List App – Task 6 (August 2025)

In this task, I built a **GUI-based To-Do List Application** in Java using **Swing**.  
The aim was to create a simple, interactive task manager that allows users to **add**, **view**, and **delete** tasks — all while saving the list to a text file so tasks persist between sessions.

## 🦕 What’s Inside?

In this project, I implemented:
- **Add Task** functionality with instant update to the list  
- **Delete Task** option with confirmation when no task is selected  
- **Persistent storage** using a local `tasks.txt` file  
- A clean **GUI layout** with separate panels for input, task list, and controls

## 🪼 Core Features Covered

### ✏️ Task Management
- Add tasks using a text field and button  
- Delete tasks by selecting them from the list  
- Automatic save after every change  

### 💾 Persistent Data Storage
- Reads existing tasks from `tasks.txt` on startup  
- Writes updated task list to `tasks.txt` on every change  

### 🖼 GUI Layout
- **Top panel** – Text field + Add button  
- **Center panel** – Scrollable task list  
- **Bottom panel** – Delete button neatly aligned at the bottom
